# AlphaSlaughter
A top-down 2D action game I made in Unity

The folder "Runnable Files" includes everything needed to run the game. Launch it by opening "Alpha Slaughter.exe".

The folder "Unity Project" includes all the files of the Unity project. Within there, the folder "Assets" contains the majority of what might be interesting to take a look at.
